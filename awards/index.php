    <h1>Awards</h1>
    <p>Kingston LGBT is an award winning society having won an NUS award and a Students Union award over the past 2 years.<br />
    In 2009 we won the NUS LGBT Award 2009 for Higher Education Society of the Year award. This was a great achievement for us.
    We archieved this by our excellent attitude to diversity and equality, increasing the number of women and BAMER (black, asian, minority ethnic and refugee) members,
    holding weekly social events in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic environments, having workshops for sexual health.<br />
    We've also become a campaining society in during 2008/09 with a campaign to tackle homophobia in schools and a fundraiser for the Terrence Higgins Trust.</p>
