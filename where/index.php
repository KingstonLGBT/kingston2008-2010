<h1>Where &amp; When</h1>
    <p>The LGBT Society at Kingston University is friendly and diverse, with a range of different events and meetings to suit different people, as we all know people's interests vary. We hold our meetings in <span class="yellow bold">Knights Park room TK51</span> at <span class="yellow bold">6.30pm on Thursdays</span> although you will usually find a gathering of members in Knights Park Bar from 6pm for a quick get together before heading upstairs, as Knights Park can be a maze and it is not always easy to find the room when you are new, or even if you are a regular member. If you are unable to locate Knights Park Bar, then ask at Knights Park reception. The bar opens out onto a patio area next to the river, which you can reach from a small pedestrian bridge off Portland Road.</p>
    <p>After our meetings it's nice to wind down and have a chat in the bar before everyone goes their separate ways.</p>
    <p>We will try to vary the meetings between outside events and trips and indoor informational and educational meetings. If this is the case then you will be notified by email and asked if you wish to attend. Further details will then be sent out about meeting points on route.</p>
    <p>The LGBT Society focuses on what the members want. If you have heard about an event, exhibition or play or anything else which you feel members will be interested in then do not hesitate to contact a member of the committee.</p>
    <p>We look forward to welcoming members, both new and continuing throughout the year.</p>
