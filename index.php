<h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Kingston University's LGBT Society is here to represent and support students who feel they fall under any of the categories of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans). Kingston LGBT is an open and diverse atmosphere where we encourage people from all walks of life and diversity strands. Not only do we support LGBT students but we actively encourage heterosexual students along to our meetings, to come and enjoy the diverse environment in which we meet. Kingston LGBT understands that LGBT can mean a lot more than just lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans, and as such we have an open doors policy where we celebrate our asexual, queer, questioning, and curious members.</p>
    <p>Kingston LGBT's weekly meetings are a great place in which to meet new people, make new friends and socialise with people like you. We organise a variety of different activities and social events throughout the year, in Kingston and London-wide. We also operate as a campaigning group for LGBT issues in the local and wider community.</p>
    <p>Kingston LGBT works alongside Kingston University's LGBT Executive officer whose job it is to ensure LGBT students are fairly represented ensuring students are treated with equality and dignity. The Executive officer makes certain LGBT students are celebrated by the university and the students' union.</p>
    <p>So, if you would like to meet new people, get to know what services are available to you, come to terms with challenges in your life, (such as coming out or discrimination) or if you'd just like someone to talk to, come and give us a go!</p>
    <p>In the meantime, feel free to navigate your way around the rest of this site in order to get a feel of what we are about. Please feel welcome to contact us via e-mail if you have any questions, queries, comments or concerns. We hope to see you soon at our next meeting.</p>
