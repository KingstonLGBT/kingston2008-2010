    <h1>Browser Compatability</h1>
    <p>Kingston LGBT's website has a few browser requirements one of which is <b>JavaScript</b>. You need to have a JavaScript enabled browser to
       get full functionality of the Kingston LGBT website. Browsers without JavaScript can still use the site but not all it's features.</p>
    <p>There are several compatability issues with <b>Internet Explorer</b>. With all versions transparency doesn't work, with version 7
    the banner won't scroll and the site does not display correctly on 6 and below.</p>

    <p>This site is best viewed in Firefox</p>
